Work Impact
Efficient EKS Microservices Onboarding: I led the rapid onboarding of microservices on Amazon EKS for our project. By streamlining deployment workflows and optimizing resource allocation, I ensured that new services were integrated without delays, reducing time-to-market and enhancing productivity. This not only accelerated project timelines but also contributed to meeting strategic deadlines.

Development of a Comprehensive EKS Dashboard: I designed and implemented a custom dashboard for EKS that consolidated all cluster metrics under a single interface. This dashboard provides real-time visibility into cluster performance, usage trends, and potential issues, empowering the team to monitor and manage resources more efficiently. As a result, it has improved decision-making and reduced response times to incidents.

Enhanced Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing: By organizing regular training sessions and documentation updates, I facilitated team-wide familiarity with our EKS setup and best practices for microservices management. These sessions not only enhanced the team's technical expertise but also fostered a collaborative environment, ensuring that team members could seamlessly troubleshoot and manage the EKS infrastructure.
