How It Works for Scaling Pods and Nodes
Pod Scheduling and Node Provisioning:

When unschedulable pods are detected, Karpenter dynamically provisions the optimal node.
Nodes are terminated when workloads reduce, ensuring cost efficiency.
Integration with Spot Instances:

Karpenter prioritizes spot instances for cost savings while maintaining workload reliability.
Improved Node Affinity and Taint Handling:

Automatically adjusts based on affinity/anti-affinity and tolerations.
Seamless Monitoring with AWS Node Viewer:

Monitor node health, resource usage, and performance bottlenecks in real time.
Best Practices
Right-Size Provisioners:

Define limits based on workload patterns to avoid over- or under-provisioning.
Monitor Node Health:

Use AWS Node Viewer to ensure nodes are not overutilized or underutilized.
Spot Instance Usage:

Configure fallback strategies for workloads requiring high availability.
Optimize Pod Scheduling:

Use Karpenter provisioners to optimize node selection for specific pod requirements.
Conclusion
Karpenter, combined with AWS Node Viewer, provides a robust solution for efficient scaling in EKS. By dynamically provisioning nodes and offering real-time monitoring, DevOps teams can optimize costs, improve performance, and ensure reliability.
