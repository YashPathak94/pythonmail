Subject: Update on Pods Stuck in "ContainerCreating" State

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I wanted to provide an update on the ongoing issue with pods being stuck in the "ContainerCreating" state. Here are the steps we've taken so far to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

Tried Static and Dynamic Provisioning of Persistent Volumes (PVs): We attempted provisioning with both static and dynamic approaches. While the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are in a "Bound" state, the pods are still not getting provisioned.

Node Scaling: We scaled out the nodes and attempted to provision the pod on the newly added nodes. Unfortunately, this did not resolve the issue.

Cluster Upgrade: We upgraded the cluster to version 1.29, but the problem persists.

Testing with Generic Pods: We verified that generic pods (without specific configurations) are able to get provisioned using the same Storage Class, PV, and PVC setup.

Despite these efforts, the pods in question remain stuck in the "ContainerCreating" state. We suspect there may be an underlying issue related to storage configuration or network connectivity impacting these specific pods.

We are continuing to investigate and will keep you updated with any new findings. If there are additional diagnostic steps or information needed, please let us know.
