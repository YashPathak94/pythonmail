Subject: Kubecost Licensing Options and Recommendations for EKS Clusters

Dear [Manager’s Name / Team],

As part of our ongoing cost visibility and optimization initiatives across our EKS environments, we have evaluated Kubecost licensing options available via AWS Marketplace and the EKS add-on model.

🔹 Key Findings

Free EKS-Optimized Kubecost Bundle (AWS Add-on)

No additional licensing cost; available directly from AWS Marketplace.

Provides namespace- and workload-level cost visibility.

Limitations:

15 days metric retention only.

Core limit of ~250 vCPUs per cluster.

Lacks advanced features like cross-cluster aggregation, RBAC/SSO, long-term reporting, and enterprise support.

Kubecost Enterprise (via AWS Marketplace Subscription)

Example subscription: $15,000 annually for up to 250 vCPUs.

Benefits include:

Unlimited clusters and core coverage.

Unlimited retention of cost and usage data.

Cross-cluster and multi-cloud cost aggregation.

Advanced features (RBAC, SSO, custom pricing, saved reports, API access).

Vendor support and SLA.

Impact of Scale (Single vs Multi-Cluster)

For a single EKS cluster with limited cores, the free add-on may be sufficient initially.

For multi-cluster production environments with >250 cores, the enterprise license is strongly recommended to ensure unified reporting, better cost allocation, and longer-term visibility.

🔹 Recommendations

Short-term: Enable the free EKS Kubecost add-on to gain immediate visibility for dev/test environments.

Mid to Long-term: Consider moving to Kubecost Enterprise licensing for production and multi-cluster setups to support:

Accurate chargeback/showback by teams.

Long-term historical analysis.

Advanced governance and reporting.

🔹 Next Steps

I recommend we align with Procurement and AWS Marketplace team to:

Evaluate enterprise subscription options (based on our total EKS vCPU usage).

Explore potential volume discounts for multi-cluster licensing.

Define rollout plan — starting with free version in dev, then extending to prod with enterprise license.

Please let me know if you’d like me to prepare a cost-comparison sheet (free vs enterprise, single vs multi-cluster) specific to our environment.

👉 Do you want me to also prepare a 1-slide cost comparison (table format) that you can attach with this mail for easier management review?

Perfect 👍 Here’s a 1-slide cost comparison table you can attach to your mail for management review.

📊 Kubecost Licensing Cost Comparison
Feature	Free (EKS Add-on)	Enterprise (AWS Marketplace Subscription)
License Cost	$0 (add-on is free)	Example: $15,000/year for up to 250 vCPUs
Cluster Coverage	Single cluster (EKS only), up to 250 cores	Unlimited clusters, multi-cloud supported
Metric Retention	15 days	Unlimited historical retention
Cross-Cluster View	❌ Not available	✅ Full cross-cluster & multi-cloud
Governance (RBAC, SSO, Saved Reports)	❌ Limited	✅ Included
Custom Pricing / Enterprise Discounts	❌ Not supported	✅ Supported (Reserved, Spot, enterprise discounts)
Support & SLA	AWS support (basic)	Vendor support + SLA
Best Fit	Small / dev/test clusters	Production / multi-cluster, FinOps adoption

👉 Suggested way to present this in PPT:

Use a 2-column comparison table with ✅ and ❌ icons.

Add highlight color (green for Enterprise features).

End the slide with:
“Recommendation: Start with free EKS add-on in dev, move to Enterprise for multi-cluster production.”
