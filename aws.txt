Chronology of AWS Support Case for EFS Issue in EKS Environment
1. Initial Investigation and Findings
Issue Identified: EFS was missing Mount Targets, causing issues with StorageClass configuration.
Action Taken: Updated the StorageClass yaml to point to the correct filesystem ID.
Status: Configuration updated, but issue persisted.
2. Testing and Persistent Issue
Deployment Test: Jenkins deployment tested with corrected filesystem ID.
Outcome: Pod stuck in "ContainerCreating" state.
Logs Analysis: EFS CSI driver logs checked, no clear errors found.
Next Step: Advised further testing and log monitoring.
3. Further Debugging Steps Suggested by AWS
Verbose Logging: Recommended enabling verbose/debug logging for EFS CSI driver.
Instructions Provided:
Enable debug logging for efs-utils.
Deploy again to capture detailed logs.
Goal: Gather more in-depth information to diagnose the issue.
4. Manual Mounting Attempt and Troubleshooting
Additional Steps: AWS advised manual EFS mounting to troubleshoot accessibility issues.
Alternative Test: Suggested creating a “test” EFS to isolate and troubleshoot configuration issues.
Objective: Verify if the existing EFS setup or a fresh setup could resolve the problem.
5. Cluster Upgrade and Scaling Attempts
Node Scaling: Increased the number of nodes to test resource availability.
Cluster Upgrade: Upgraded EKS cluster to version 1.29.
Result: Pod remained in "ContainerCreating" state.
Conclusion: Issue may be related to configuration or connectivity, not resources.
6. VolumeHandle Configuration and Access Points
Investigation Outcome: PVs were pointing to the same folder in the EFS across pods.
Suggested Solution: Configure unique access points for each PV to prevent mounting conflicts.
Objective: Avoid ambiguity in Kubernetes volume handling.
7. Final Recommendations and Next Steps
Access Points Creation: Recommended adding more access points to the EFS.
Configuration Update: Update PV yaml files to reference each new access point.
Final Test: Redeploy with the new configuration and report results.
AWS Support: Will continue monitoring and provide additional support if required.
Summary of Actions and Next Steps
Current Status: Issue under investigation; awaiting results of final test with updated access points.
AWS Support Engagement: Active monitoring and readiness to escalate if the problem persists.
Recommended Follow-Up: Schedule a review with AWS after deploying the updated configuration.
