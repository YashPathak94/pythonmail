Here is a summary draft about the dashboard:

EKS Dashboard Summary
The VENERABLE - EKS Dashboard is a comprehensive monitoring and reporting tool designed to provide a unified view of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. This dashboard brings all critical cluster information under one interface, enabling efficient monitoring, resource utilization tracking, and performance analysis.

Features:
Cluster Overview:

Displays the total number of clusters, nodes, and pods across environments.
Provides environment-wise breakdown of clusters and their respective node and pod counts.
Node-Level Insights:

Details about each node, including instance type, CPU and memory capacity, and utilization percentages.
Enables identification of high-resource-consuming nodes.
Namespace & Pod Monitoring:

Lists namespaces with associated pod details.
Displays pod-level CPU and memory utilization for granular tracking.
Top Consumers Analysis:

Identifies the top resource consumers (CPU or memory) within a cluster.
Assists in resource optimization by pinpointing areas of high demand.
Environment Filtering:

Allows filtering by environment (e.g., prod, dev, test) for focused insights.
Supports a dropdown-based selection for dynamic data presentation.
Downloadable Reports:

Generates downloadable reports for offline analysis and sharing.
Use Cases:
Centralized Monitoring: Consolidates data from multiple EKS clusters, reducing the need to switch between AWS Management Console and other tools.
Resource Utilization Reporting: Provides real-time insights into CPU and memory usage across clusters, nodes, and pods.
Environment-Specific Insights: Helps teams focus on specific environments like production or development for targeted troubleshooting and monitoring.
Optimization Guidance: Identifies underutilized or overutilized resources, aiding in capacity planning and cost reduction.
Incident Resolution: Accelerates troubleshooting by providing detailed information about resource consumption and cluster performance.
Benefits:
The dashboard simplifies the monitoring of distributed workloads by aggregating metrics and logs under one umbrella. It enables teams to:

Gain a bird's-eye view of their EKS infrastructure.
Proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
Optimize resources to maintain cost efficiency.
Ensure consistent performance across different environments.
This unified approach to monitoring improves operational visibility, enhances decision-making, and empowers teams to maintain robust and scalable Kubernetes ecosystems effectively.

Help me to create chronology report for incident of node replacement in eks cluster where node auto repair is implemented, and how it helped the pod to spawned on new node and one replica of pod being run on other node ensuring no downtime 
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a chronology report template for an incident involving node replacement in an EKS cluster with node auto-repair enabled. This report explains how the system responded automatically, ensuring high availability and zero downtime:

üóÇÔ∏è Chronology Report: EKS Node Replacement Incident
Incident Title: Automatic Node Replacement via Node Auto-Repair in EKS
Environment: EKS Cluster - prod-us-east-1
Date: 10 June 2025
Time (IST): 03:15 PM ‚Äì 03:45 PM
Impact: No downtime observed, application remained fully available
Auto Repair Mechanism: Enabled via Managed Node Group with Node Auto-Replacement

‚è±Ô∏è Timeline of Events
Time (IST)	Event
03:15 PM	Node ip-10-0-1-24.ec2.internal reported NotReady for 5+ minutes.
03:16 PM	EKS Cluster detected node as unhealthy via node health checks.
03:17 PM	Auto-repair triggered termination of the unhealthy node.
03:19 PM	New EC2 instance initiated by the node group to replace the node.
03:23 PM	New node joined the cluster and became Ready.
03:24 PM	Kubernetes scheduler detected unscheduled pods and assigned them to the new node.
03:25 PM	One replica of the critical application pod was already running on a healthy node.
03:26 PM	Second replica successfully scheduled and running on the new node.
03:30 PM	All pods reported Running status with no errors.
03:45 PM	Incident closed. No alerts triggered from external monitoring systems.
‚úÖ Auto-Repair Benefits Observed
Self-Healing: The unhealthy node was automatically replaced without manual intervention.

High Availability Maintained: Due to ReplicaSet, at least one replica of the pod was always running on a healthy node.

Zero Downtime: Application traffic remained unaffected throughout the incident.

Efficient Scheduling: Kubernetes quickly rescheduled pods to the new node upon node join.

üîç Root Cause Analysis
Reason for Node Failure: The node experienced a hardware/network-level failure detected by AWS Health Checks.

Auto-Repair Action: Automatically terminated the node and replaced it with a new one in the Auto Scaling Group.
