Here is a summary draft about the dashboard:

EKS Dashboard Summary
The VENERABLE - EKS Dashboard is a comprehensive monitoring and reporting tool designed to provide a unified view of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. This dashboard brings all critical cluster information under one interface, enabling efficient monitoring, resource utilization tracking, and performance analysis.

Features:
Cluster Overview:

Displays the total number of clusters, nodes, and pods across environments.
Provides environment-wise breakdown of clusters and their respective node and pod counts.
Node-Level Insights:

Details about each node, including instance type, CPU and memory capacity, and utilization percentages.
Enables identification of high-resource-consuming nodes.
Namespace & Pod Monitoring:

Lists namespaces with associated pod details.
Displays pod-level CPU and memory utilization for granular tracking.
Top Consumers Analysis:

Identifies the top resource consumers (CPU or memory) within a cluster.
Assists in resource optimization by pinpointing areas of high demand.
Environment Filtering:

Allows filtering by environment (e.g., prod, dev, test) for focused insights.
Supports a dropdown-based selection for dynamic data presentation.
Downloadable Reports:

Generates downloadable reports for offline analysis and sharing.
Use Cases:
Centralized Monitoring: Consolidates data from multiple EKS clusters, reducing the need to switch between AWS Management Console and other tools.
Resource Utilization Reporting: Provides real-time insights into CPU and memory usage across clusters, nodes, and pods.
Environment-Specific Insights: Helps teams focus on specific environments like production or development for targeted troubleshooting and monitoring.
Optimization Guidance: Identifies underutilized or overutilized resources, aiding in capacity planning and cost reduction.
Incident Resolution: Accelerates troubleshooting by providing detailed information about resource consumption and cluster performance.
Benefits:
The dashboard simplifies the monitoring of distributed workloads by aggregating metrics and logs under one umbrella. It enables teams to:

Gain a bird's-eye view of their EKS infrastructure.
Proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
Optimize resources to maintain cost efficiency.
Ensure consistent performance across different environments.
This unified approach to monitoring improves operational visibility, enhances decision-making, and empowers teams to maintain robust and scalable Kubernetes ecosystems effectively.
